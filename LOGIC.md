# My-Trade logic

The owner's own rules, written down in plain words and versioned with the code.
Nothing here comes from another product. Where a choice is still open it is marked
**(owner to decide)**; the page uses the smallest reasonable choice meanwhile, and
the owner can overrule it by saying so.

## Layer 1: Levels - built

A *move* is the distance between a low and a high. The levels sit part-way back
along that move, at fixed fractions of it:

    0%   23.6%   38.2%   50%   61.8%   78.6%   100%

0% is where the move ended, 100% is where it began. For a move that went **up**
(low first, then high) the fractions are measured **down from the high**; for a move
that went **down**, **up from the low**. So the 61.8% level of an up move from
22,000 to 23,000 is 23,000 - 0.618 x 1,000 = 22,382.

These fractions are the Fibonacci ratios: each is the limit of a Fibonacci number
divided by a later one (0.618 = 1/1.618, 0.382 = 0.618 squared, 0.236 = 0.618
cubed, 0.786 = the square root of 0.618; 50% is not a Fibonacci ratio but is kept
as the halfway mark). Traders watch these fractions as places a price may pause or
turn after a move. Whether that holds is for the owner's own record to show.

**Which move** - a switch on the index page, remembered per browser:

- *Previous day* (default): yesterday's low to yesterday's high. Only the day's
  open, high, low and close are known, so the day is taken as an up move when it
  closed above its open, else a down move **(owner to decide)**.
- *Today so far*: today's low to today's high, an up move when the last price is
  above today's open **(owner to decide)**. Blank until the market has traded today.
- *Bars shown*: the lowest low and highest high among the candles on the chart;
  whichever came first says which way the move went.
- *No levels*: hides them.

**Ratios**: the seven above **(owner to decide: add or remove)**.

**What the page does with them**: draws each level as a line across the chart with
its percentage on the price axis (the two ends solid, the rest dashed), and shows
one line of text: the move, its direction, and how far the last price is from the
nearest level. Nothing else yet.

## Layer 2: Signals - not built

What a candle must do at a level before it counts **(owner to decide)**: touch it,
close beyond it, close back after poking through, its colour, its size, anything
else the owner looks for.

## Layer 3: Paper orders - not built

Which way to trade on a signal, where the stop and the target go, and when to get
out if neither is hit **(owner to decide)**. Paper only, with a log that keeps the
score, before anything real.
